# AnimTransfer
Transfers animation from a different joint hierarchy
You need 2 different hierarchies however they need to have identical names on the bones and the same amount of bones.
All you need to do is put your source skeleton in a group called "og" and your target skeleton in a group called "new".
Select the root bone in your source skeleton and run the script.
